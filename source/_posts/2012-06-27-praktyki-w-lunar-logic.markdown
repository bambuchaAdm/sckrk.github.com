Lunar Logic, firma która zapewnia SCKRK wikt i opierunek, planuje letnie praktyki dla studentów.
Praktyki są płatne i ich celem jest nauka Ruby/Rails/programowania, a nie wyrobnictwo albo parzenie kawy, więc możliwe, że część z Was to ogłoszenie zainteresuje.

## Ogłoszenie:

Would you like to learn how to code in Ruby? Or how NOT to do it? From people who remember Rails 1.0?

We are looking for passionate programmers who are familiar with or are willing to learn Ruby for summer apprenticeship (with a possibility of further cooperation).

If you're tired of disorganized student projects, [Lunar Logic][0] offers you an opportunity to experience Scrum and Kanban in a real environment. Our working ethic consists of a stress-free workplace where your efforts and actions matter more than time you spend here. We value honesty and self-development through open criticism. 
You will learn with us.
 
In case you haven't heard of us before, Lunar Logic has been involved in:

* [EuRuKo 2010 Conference][1]
* [ACE! Conference][2]
* [Front Row Conference][3]
* [Code Retreat][4]
* [Software Craftsmanship in Kraków][5]
* [Kraków Ruby Users Group] [6]
* [NoSQL Summer][7]
* [Hackerspace Kraków][8]

Our requirements are simple:

* a bit of cleverness,
* willingness for learning new skills,
* communicative English.

What we offer:

* 1000-2000zł net pay depending on experience and knowledge,
* a master (guru, mentor - you name it), who will guide you during your apprenticeship,
* company bicycle, 
* yoga classes two times a week.
